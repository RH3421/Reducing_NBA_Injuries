## Background
Season-ending injuries are some of the most devasting for NBA players. Not even a decade ago, most of these injuries, including ACL and Achilles tendon rupture were career-ending. While medical technology has advanced since then, season-ending injuries are still extremely distressing for players, front office staff, and fans.

## Business Problem
Given the physical, emotional, and financial toll of season-ending injuries, I sought to quantify risk factors and identify NBA players at high risk. 

## Data Understanding
Using a NBA injury dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ghopkins/nba-injuries-2010-2018) with more than 17,000 entries and [NBA player stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/traditional/?sort=PLAYER_NAME&dir=-1&Season=2009-10&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) to create a combined dataset, I was able to link prior season stats with current season risk of season-ending injury. The hope is that such information may be used to modify active and resting behavior to reduce risk of injury to benefit NBA players.

Given the relatively low incidence of season-ending injuries, f1 score was determined to be the primary metric of model valuation. Additionally, accuracy and ROC AUC were utilized.

## Modeling


## Results
Best model f1 score

The 3 most impactful predictors of season-ending injury were as follows:

  1. 
  2. 
  3. 

## Conclusions 



## Recommendations

Based on the analysis it is recommended that players implement 3 targeted approaches to reduce risk:

  1.  
  2. 
  3.
